    "content1": "Originally from Lyon, I first studied medicine, then molecular biology, keen to unravel the cellular mysteries of human beings. After health concerns that forced me to reconsider my career choices, I studied law and human resources management. I then worked in various professions within SMEs and Key Accounts. However, I quickly realize that this job puts me in conflict with some of my values. In search of a more authentic path and more in keeping with my identity, I naturally turn to alternative medicine, psychology and Ericksonian hypnosis. A lucid and hypersensitive dreamer since childhood, I have long searched for answers in books in order to channel my sensitivity and empathy. However, it was only by encountering hypnosis that I was able to put words into my altered nocturnal state of consciousness. And then there were also my hands, those hands that heal when I put them on a sensitive area of ​​the other's body.",
    "content2": "Becoming aware of the meaning of my existence, I then trained in various alternative body medicines: magnetism, Reiki and Tui Na, for example, but also in social psychology, psychopathology, at the practitioner level in Ericksonian hypnosis with Kévin FINEL, in NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) and in RITMO® (combination of hypnosis and EMDR) with Lili RUGGIERI. My curiosity of the human being pushes me to train myself continuously in order to always better apprehend and understand the other in order to better accompany him in his quest for meaning, happiness and well-being. All this in a constant desire to improve and evolve my approach. I am also a member of the Syndicat Des Métiers de l'Hypnose in order to guarantee my clients a safe ethical and professional framework. Having been heckled by life, others have accompanied me so that I can find my way, it is my turn to light your way for a while so that you can find your own light.",
